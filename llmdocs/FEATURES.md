## Memory Mode Management

- `Creation date`: 26/05/2025 (inferred)
- `Description`: This feature enhances the management of custom Roo modes, specifically the "memory" mode. It ensures that the `.roomodes` configuration file is correctly handled, preventing duplication of the "memory" mode and gracefully managing file parsing errors.
- `Dependencies`: Node.js `fs` module
- `Files`:
    - [`index.js`](index.js): Contains the `manageRoomodesFile` function, which implements the core logic for reading, parsing, updating, and writing the `.roomodes` file.
    - [`.roomodes`](.roomodes): The primary configuration file for Roo custom modes, which is managed by this feature.
    - [`files/.roomodes`](files/.roomodes): A source or template `.roomodes` file used for initial setup or fallback.
