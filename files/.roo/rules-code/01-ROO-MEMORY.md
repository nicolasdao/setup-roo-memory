After completing your task and before returning results:

1. **Update the relevant files in `./llmdocs/`**:

   * `./llmdocs/FILES.md`: When adding, modifying, or deleting source files.
   * `./llmdocs/FEATURES.md`: When adding, modifying, or removing features.
   * `./llmdocs/STACK.md`: When the tech stack changes.
   * `./llmdocs/LOOK_AND_FEEL.md`: When visual or UX aspects change.
   * `./llmdocs/IMPORTANT_NOTES.md`: When uncovering key maintenance or stability insights.

2. **Read `llmdocs/DOC_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md` before editing any file**. It contains formatting and update instructions.

3. **Add a `DOC_CHANGES` section** in your final response:

   * List each `./llmdocs/` file you modified.
   * For each file, provide a bullet explaining what changed.

> ðŸ’¡ If no `./llmdocs/` files were changed, omit the `DOC_CHANGES` section.
