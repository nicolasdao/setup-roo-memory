## [1] Instruction: architect-memory-mgmt

=== BEGIN instruction: architect-memory-mgmt ===

Before architecting your solution, consult these docs at the project root. Only read files that are likely to help (e.g., ignore `LOOK_AND_FEEL.md` for a memory leak issue):

- `./llmdocs/FILES.md`: Source file structure.
- `./llmdocs/FEATURES.md`: Implemented features.
- `./llmdocs/STACK.md`: Tech stack.
- `./llmdocs/LOOK_AND_FEEL.md`: Visual and UX design.
- `./llmdocs/IMPORTANT_NOTES.md`: Key implementation or project constraints.

Use this context to guide your architectural decisions.
