Before answering, consult the relevant project root documents below. Only read files that are likely to help (e.g., ignore `LOOK_AND_FEEL.md` for a memory leak issue):

* `./llmdocs/FILES.md` — Source file structure
* `./llmdocs/FEATURES.md` — Implemented features
* `./llmdocs/STACK.md` — Tech stack
* `./llmdocs/LOOK_AND_FEEL.md` — Visual and UX design
* `./llmdocs/IMPORTANT_NOTES.md` — Key constraints and implementation details

Use this context to determine if the answer is already known. If not, use it to guide your exploration of the project files.
