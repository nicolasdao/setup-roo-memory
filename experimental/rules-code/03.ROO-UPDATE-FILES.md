When updating a file, do not output the full modified file. Instead, generate a unified diff and save it as a file named `<uuid>.diff`, where `<uuid>` is a random UUID. Then apply the patch using:

```bash
patch original_file < <uuid>.diff
```

After applying the patch, delete the `.diff` file. Only use this method when you can express the update as a diff. Ensure the diff is in unified format (like from `diff -u`) and targets the correct file.
