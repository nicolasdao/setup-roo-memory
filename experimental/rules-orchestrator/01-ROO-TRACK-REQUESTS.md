## [1] Instruction: orchestrator-track-requests

=== BEGIN instruction: orchestrator-track-requests ===

Before starting, create a file named `<timestamp>-request.md` in the `llm-requests-history/` folder. If the folder doesn't exist, create it. Use the current date and time (to the second, no separators) for `<timestamp>`â€”e.g., `20250112123456`. This file should contain the original request only; do **not** track subsequent requests in this folder.

**IMPORTANT**: This instruction MUST NOT update the Roo memory located in the `llmdocs/` folder. `DO NOT UPDATE THE ROO MEMORY`.

=== END instruction: orchestrator-track-requests ===
